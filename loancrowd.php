If the campaign does not reach its funding goal within this time period, the funds collected are refunded to the Funders.

                    Every campaign has a funding goal and only up to 60 days to reach this funding goal.

                    Fund transfer and management
                    Fin-Tech only enables the flow of funds from funders to Campaigners and is not the final recipient of funds raised (other than commission payable by the Campaigner) on its platform.
                    For all Campaigns which successfully reach their fund targets, fund transfers are only made to Indian bank accounts after 15 days of the end of the campaign through net transfer or by cheque. Fin-Tech shall deduct all fees including GST and other taxes, if any as listed above and thereafter transfers the net amount.
                    If the Campaigner has not met his funding goal within the stipulated time period, the funds are transferred back to funders. The payment gateways shall deduct their commission on such refunds. Fin-Tech shall not charge any commission on such 'Unsuccessful Campaigns.'
                    Fund transfer in case of Indian based and Foreign based Campaigns.
                    Campaigns may be either
                    1. India based (i.e. campaigns where campaigners seek to implement the project in India and accordingly, have an Indian bank account into which the campaign funder’s contributions may be released) or
                    2. foreign based (i.e. campaigns where campaigners seek to implement the project outside India and accordingly have a foreign bank account into which the campaign funder’s contributions may be released).
                    Incase of India based campaigns, all contributions made by funders through Indian bank accounts/ Indian credit / debit cards or other Indian payment instruments shall be initially received into a Fin-Tech India account (in India) and all contributions made by funders through foreign bank accounts/ foreign credit / debit cards or other foreign payment instruments shall be initially received into a Fin-Tech USA account (in USA). Such funds shall thereafter, depending on whether the campaign is successful or not, be transferred to the bank account of the campaigner or refunded to the relevant funders. It is clarified that incase of unsuccessful campaigns, payment gateway charges (if applied by the relevant payment gateway) shall be applicable at the time of refund.
                    Incase of foreign based campaigns, all contributions made by funders, irrespective of the nature of bank account or payment instrument, shall be initially received into a Fin-Tech USA account (in USA). Such funds shall thereafter, depending on whether the campaign is successful or not, be transferred to the bank account of the campaigner or refunded to the relevant funders. It is clarified that incase of unsuccessful campaigns, payment gateway charges (if applied by the relevant payment gateway) shall be applicable at the time of refund.
                    Foreign funds
                    All foreign contributions shall be required to be made in strict compliance with Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976. The campaigner represents and warrants that it is aware of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 and its contents and is seeking contributions in full compliance with the provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976. Further, the campaigner covenants that it shall, at all times, remain in absolute and full compliance with the provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976, in relation to the campaign.

                    The campaigner agrees that Fin-Tech is relying on the Campaigner’s specific representation of compliance with Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 and is agreeing to enter into this agreement based on such representation. In the event that such representation is inaccurate, false or misleading, the campaigner shall solely be responsible and liable and shall indemnity Fin-Tech for any and all direct or indirect, loss or damage suffered by Fin-Tech.

                    Only if the Campaigner is an NGO, it shall have to be registered/approved with Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 to be able to receive foreign contributions. Else foreign contributions will be restricted on such Campaigner’s campaign.
                    Taxation
                    Campaigners must bear any and all tax liabilities on the funds raised through Fin-Tech. These taxes may include, but are not limited to, income tax, VAT, service tax and GST applicable on the fund's raised or on the procurement of rewards. Fin-Tech is not liable to provide any tax or legal advice to Campaigners. Information provided in Fin-Tech FAQs are only a guideline and subject to change without notice.
                    Use of funds
                    The campaigner must use the funds collected through Fin-Tech solely for the project described in their crowdfunding campaign. Campaigners shall be liable to legal prosecution by Funders and/or Fin-Tech (jointly and severally) if they are found to be using funds for any purpose other than that specified at the time of raising the funds, or other inappropriate purposes. The Site can discontinue the campaign if it gets any notification of misuse of funds or use of funds for another purpose other than the stated creative project at any time of the campaign, without any notice or discussion to the campaign owner at the Company's sole discretion.
                    Project completion
                    While campaigners have full project ownership and the right to complete it, they are accountable and obliged to finish the project by the deadline they have set. Campaigners must also keep the funders updated about the work in progress in case of delays to avoid funder dissatisfaction.
                    The Company or the Site does not make any claims or guarantees on behalf of the campaigner regarding the completion of the project and usage of the funds raised solely for the purpose of the project.
                    Similarly, the Company or the Website does not take any responsibility for making sure that the project for which the funds are raised through its Site is completed and made available to the Funders. The Funders are free to get in touch with the campaign owner directly and solving any dispute that arises regarding the campaign or the project.
                    Campaign rewards
                    Campaigners must offer at least 3 rewards to funders in exchange for their funding. These rewards cannot, under any circumstances, be financial in nature (e.g., interest on funding amount, ownership/equity stake, revenue/profit share).
                    Campaigners are solely responsible for the procurement and delivery of rewards to funders and must meet the rewards delivery date specified by them on the campaign page.
                    Fin-Tech will not be responsible for any liabilities resulting from funders' dissatisfaction with rewards fulfilment. Campaigners acknowledge that they are aware that funders may take legal action if they don not receive the rewards promised by the campaigner by the specified timeline.
                    Fin-Tech branding & marketing
                    Campaigners must include Fin-Tech logo branding on all project and/or campaign related marketing collaterals, whether online or offline (e.g., online banners, offline flyers) as per Fin-Tech brand and logo guidelines. Fin-Tech should be credited as the project's "Online Crowdfunding Partner" at campaign or project related offline events. Also successful campaigners are obliged and undertake to attend and/or lead Fin-Tech branding & marketing activities such as events, ad videos, interviews, etc.
                    Campaign cancellation
                    Notwithstanding anything set out herein, Fin-Tech reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a campaign at any time and for any reason.

Subject to the above clause, all Disputes or differences regarding this Agreement shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration. In the event of such arbitration:
                    • The arbitration shall be in accordance with the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration, in force at the relevant time (which is deemed to be incorporated into this Agreement by reference);
                    • All proceedings of such arbitration shall be in the English language. The place / seat of the arbitration shall be Mumbai and the courts of Mumbai shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings;
                    • The Law governing the conduct of arbitration and the arbitration proceedings shall be the laws of India;
                    • The arbitration shall be conducted before a sole arbitrator appointed by Fin-Tech;
                    • Arbitration awards shall be reasoned awards and shall be final and binding on the disputing parties; and
                    • The existence or subsistence of a dispute between the parties, or the commencement or continuation of arbitration proceedings, shall not, in any manner, prevent or postpone the performance of those obligations of the parties under the Agreement which are not in dispute, and the arbitrators shall give due consideration to such performance, if any, in making a final award.
                    Nothing shall preclude a party from seeking interim or permanent equitable or injunctive relief, or both. The pursuit of equitable or injunctive relief shall not be a waiver of the right of the parties to pursue any other remedy or relief through the arbitration.
                    Governing Law
                    These Terms of Use shall be governed by and constructed in accordance with the laws of India without reference to conflict of laws principles and disputes arising in relation hereto shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Mumbai.
                    Integration and Severability
                    These Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, the Online Campaigner Agreement and other referenced material herein or on the Site, are the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to the Service, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and the Company with respect to the Service and govern the future relationship. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
                    Miscellaneous
                    The Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with the Company's prior written consent. The Company may assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. All notices under the Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p>
