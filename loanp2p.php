						have an Indian bank account into which the campaign funder’s contributions may be released) or
						2. foreign based (i.e. campaigns where campaigners seek to implement the project outside India and
						accordingly have a foreign bank account into which the campaign funder’s contributions may be released).
						Incase of India based campaigns, all contributions made by funders through Indian bank accounts/ Indian
						credit / debit cards or other Indian payment instruments shall be initially received into a Fin-Tech India
						account (in India) and all contributions made by funders through foreign bank accounts/ foreign credit /
						debit cards or other foreign payment instruments shall be initially received into a Fin-Tech USA account (in
						USA). Such funds shall thereafter, depending on whether the campaign is successful or not, be transferred to
						the bank account of the campaigner or refunded to the relevant funders. It is clarified that incase of
						unsuccessful campaigns, payment gateway charges (if applied by the relevant payment gateway) shall be
						applicable at the time of refund.
						Incase of foreign based campaigns, all contributions made by funders, irrespective of the nature of bank
						account or payment instrument, shall be initially received into a Fin-Tech USA account (in USA). Such funds

						Regulation Act, 1976 and its contents and is seeking contributions in full compliance with the provisions of
						Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976. Further, the campaigner covenants that it shall, at all times,
						remain in absolute and full compliance with the provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976, in
						relation to the campaign.

						The campaigner agrees that Fin-Tech is relying on the Campaigner’s specific representation of compliance
						with Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976 and is agreeing to enter into this agreement based on such
						representation. In the event that such representation is inaccurate, false or misleading, the campaigner
						shall solely be responsible and liable and shall indemnity Fin-Tech for any and all direct or indirect, loss
						or damage suffered by Fin-Tech.

						notification of misuse of funds or use of funds for another purpose other than the stated creative project
						at any time of the campaign, without any notice or discussion to the campaign owner at the Company's sole
						discretion.
						Project completion
						While campaigners have full project ownership and the right to complete it, they are accountable and obliged
						to finish the project by the deadline they have set. Campaigners must also keep the funders updated about
						the work in progress in case of delays to avoid funder dissatisfaction.
						The Company or the Site does not make any claims or guarantees on behalf of the campaigner regarding the
						completion of the project and usage of the funds raised solely for the purpose of the project.
						Similarly, the Company or the Website does not take any responsibility for making sure that the project for
						which the funds are raised through its Site is completed and made available to the Funders. The Funders are

						Refund
						Funders will get a refund of their contribution in case the campaign they are funding fails to achieve its
						target. The Funders agree to receive the refund either through a couriered cheque or via an online
						reversal/refund of their original payments. In case of a cheque refund (for cases where the initial
						contribution was made via cheque or bank transfer), the Funders agrees to allow Fin-Tech to deduct courier
						charges from the contribution. In case of an Online refund/ reversal (for cases of online Payment), the
						Funders agrees and acknowledges that the payment gateway has the right to deduct their charges from the
						refunded amount.
						A Funder cannot ask for a refund if a campaign he/she funded met its target. The Funders relieve the Company
						or the Site from any obligation to make a refund in such a case.
						In the event of an unreasonable delay beyond the period stipulated by the campaigner for fulfilment of the
						rewards, after a campaign has successfully met its target, a Funders may seek legal remedy directly against
						the campaigner / campaign owner.
						Campaigners may cancel or refund a contribution at any time and for any reason, and if they do so, are not
						required to deliver the reward.
						Campaigners and Funders agree to deal directly with each other, without involving Fin-Tech regarding any
						refund negotiations other than in the aforementioned scenario.
